"""Path validation, §7 classification, and inventory for tools/docs_land.sh.

Run with: python3 tools/docs_land_paths.py --worktree <docs-worktree> \
    (--gate [--] <path>... | --inventory)

Issue #410. The landing script commits and pushes exactly the paths it is
given, so which paths it may be given is a policy question, answered here in
one place rather than inside shell text:

* A path must be a literal, repository-relative Markdown file inside the docs
  worktree — no absolute paths, no traversal, no directories, no Git pathspec
  magic, no glob metacharacters (ordinary Git pathspecs glob by default, so a
  `*` would otherwise expand), no control characters (the canonical-path
  handoff below is line-delimited, so an embedded newline would split one
  name into two), the exact spelling of what is on disk and tracked (a name
  differing only by case would publish a case-conflicting tree entry through
  a case-insensitive filesystem), and no symlinks — leaf or ancestor, since a
  symlinked directory resolves the leaf outside the worktree — other than the
  verified `AGENTS.md` alias.
* A tracked `AGENTS.md` symlink to `CLAUDE.md` is canonicalized and verified.
  This repository may instead track `AGENTS.md` as a regular authoritative document;
  that file lands under its own name. An existing alias cannot be replaced
  locally to bypass its integrity checks.
* Classification is read from `origin/master`'s
  `docs/agent-workflow-contract.md` §7 — the publication tip, not the local
  copy — and applies §7's whole-component matching. A path is eligible only
  when exactly one row covers it and the row cites no `test-parsed` or
  `implementation-coupled` reason. The root instruction documents `CLAUDE.md`
  and `AGENTS.md` are the sole exception: CLAUDE.md's manual docs-worktree
  publication exception already grants them the direct lane.
* Anything unclassified fails closed with the specific missing
  classification, mirroring `tools/test_document_classification.py`.

`--gate` prints the canonical path list on stdout (one per line) and notes on
stderr, exiting nonzero with every refusal when any named path is refused.
`--inventory` prints one row per known Markdown document — tracked, untracked,
ignored, deleted, or present only on the publication tip — with its state, its
§7 row and lane, how it stands against the fetched `origin/master`, and whether
it is a ready landing candidate. Both modes are read-only.

Issue #438. That `origin/master` comparison names a DIRECTION rather than a
bare difference, because documents reach master through two lanes that never
touch this worktree — pull requests carrying pr-atomic documents, and
`tools/publish_coordination_doc.py` — so a differing document is as likely to
be upstream's newer text as it is to be work waiting to land. Direction is
read against the merge base of `HEAD` and the publication tip: only the local
side moved is `differs` (ahead, the landing candidate), only upstream moved is
`behind`, both moved is `diverged`, and an upstream-only addition — absent at
the merge base and here, present upstream — is `absent-here`. The `landable`
column keeps answering the §7/path POLICY question alone; `readiness` is the
separate operational one, so a behind, diverged, or absent-here row states
that it is not a candidate and names its remedy.
