# Land one or more documents from the docs-wip worktree onto master.
#
# Why this exists (issue #410): documentation lands on master by direct push
# (see CLAUDE.md "Markdown changes"), and the naive recipe is wrong in ways
# that have already cost real time:
#
#   * `git rebase --autostash` stashes EVERY dirty file, not just the ones
#     being landed, and replays them over a moved master — so landing doc A
#     while doc B is half-written can conflict on B;
#   * the protected-ref warning prints on every SUCCESSFUL admin-bypass push,
#     so push output cannot be read as success or failure;
#   * a bare `git commit` after staging named paths records the whole index,
#     so an unrelated staged file rides along;
#   * pushing the docs-wip branch publishes every commit on it, so a landing
#     cannot exclude an unrelated document someone already committed there.
#
# This script commits ONLY the paths you name, built directly on top of
# origin/master so no unselected committed work can ride along; gates every
# path against docs/agent-workflow-contract.md §7 as published on
# origin/master (via tools/docs_land_paths.py beside this script); warns
# BEFORE doing anything when an unselected file collides with an upstream
# change — untracked, ignored, or dirty and unequal; judges success by rev-list
# reachability, never by push output; and fast-forwards the primary checkout
# only when it is clean and no untracked or ignored file occupies a path the
# update would touch.
#
# RECONCILE FIRST (issue: stale docs worktree). The landing commit is built
# from this worktree's bytes on top of origin/master, so landing from a
# worktree that is BEHIND master overwrites every upstream edit to a selected
# path with a stale copy. The pre-flight refuses that (exit 3), which is
# correct but leaves the operator stuck whenever the branch has drifted --
# the common state, since docs-wip only advances when something lands.
#
# So the worktree is reconciled with the publication tip BEFORE anything is
# computed or published: stash the dirty documents, fast-forward (or rebase,
# when there are real local commits), then re-apply the stash as a three-way
# merge. An edit already published upstream collapses to a no-op instead of a
# conflict, an untouched-upstream edit replays cleanly, and only a genuine
# same-region divergence stops -- with nothing yet published, so stopping is
# free. -a resolves such a divergence by favouring this worktree's side per
# hunk while keeping upstream's non-conflicting hunks. -R skips the whole
# stage and lands from the worktree exactly as it stands.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/docs_land.sh -m "Commit subject" docs/foo.md [docs/bar.md ...]
#   tools/docs_land.sh -n -m "..." docs/foo.md   # dry run: plan, no changes
#   tools/docs_land.sh -f -m "..." docs/foo.md   # ignore the risk warning
#   tools/docs_land.sh -a -m "..." docs/foo.md   # auto-resolve reconcile conflicts
#   tools/docs_land.sh -R -m "..." docs/foo.md   # do not reconcile first
#   tools/docs_land.sh -l                        # inventory of landable docs
#
# Exit codes: 0 landed (or nothing to land); 1 environment failure; 2 usage;
# 3 predicted conflict without -f; 4 rebase or reconcile stopped; 5 push not
# verified; 6 a named path was refused by validation or classification.

# hashes equal while what git tracks there is a target string that does not.

# tracked file that already holds origin/master's exact blob and mode is
# what the replay produces anyway, and blocking on it refuses a landing
# over a file holding nothing. matches_upstream_blob narrows that arm to a
# content-and-mode comparison and lets those through. The untracked and ignored arms are
# unnarrowed on purpose — checkout refuses an untracked occupant and
# silently overwrites an ignored one without ever comparing content, so
# byte-equality buys them nothing.
#
# It is all detected here, before anything is published, by walking the
# (small) upstream-changed set and asking about each path's local state —
# presence on disk without an index entry covers untracked and ignored
# alike, which an --exclude-standard listing would not. Written for bash 3.2
# (macOS /bin/bash): no mapfile, no bare expansion of a possibly-empty array
